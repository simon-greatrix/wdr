<h1>Werewolf Dice Roller</h1>

<p>Do you never have enough D10s? Can you never remember what you are suppose
to roll for something? Tired of all the adding and counting involved? The
<strong>Werewolf Dice Roller</strong> is here to help!</p>

<p><a href="app/index.html"><span style="font-size:xxx-large;">Launch The App</span></a></p>

<h2>Installing</h2>

<p>The Werewolf Dice Roller (WDR) is just a web-page. <b>You don't need to install
anything.</b> Unless you want to use it where there is no wifi. In that case
good news because you can install it, because it is a "Progressive Web App".</p>

<p>On an iPhone, open WDR in Safari, hit the "Share" button and scroll down to find "Add to home screen".<p>

<p>On an android phone, open WDR in Chrome, and there should be an obvious install button.</p>

<p>On a PC, Mac or tablet, there should be a button somewhere. In Chrome it is in the address bar.</p>



<h2>Using</h2>

<p>At the top of the screen are five icons: Dice, Person, Heart, User Settings,
and History. Each of these activates a different function.</p>

<h3>Basic Rolling (The Dice icon)</h3>

<p>Set the number of dice you want to roll, set the difficulty, see the score.</p>

<p>The arrows raise and lower the number of dice and the difficulty. If you
want to change the value a lot, hit the number and a nice pop-up will allow you
to type the value you want.</p>

<p>Hit the big '?' to roll, or whatever value is display in the bottom half of
the screen.  If you get a skull, it means you botched the roll.</p>

<p>If you want to see what the numbers on the dice actually were, hit the
History icon and see your last twenty rolls.</p>

<h3>Skill Check Rolling (The Person icon)</h3>

<p>This screen is only useful after you have entered your character's
attributes and abilities. To do that, hit the User Settings icon and enter
them.</p>

<p>Set the number of dice you want to roll by saying which attribute and
ability your character is using, and what form they are in. The numbers in
parentheses show what each is contributing.</p>

<p>Set the difficulty with the arrows, or tapping on the number.</p>

<p>Tap the score to re-roll.</p>


<h3>Favourite Rolls (The Heart icon)</h3>

<p>Some rolls come up over and over again. On this page you can save your favourites.</p>

<p>Scroll up and down the list, find the one you want, and click it. You'll be
taken to the "Skill Check Rolling" with the relevant ability, attribute and
difficulty set up.</p>

<p>Hitting the "Plus" sign at the top allows you to add new favourites to the list.</p>

<p>You can re-order the list by dragging on the handle icon on the right.</p>

<p>If you get tired of one of the favourites, you can drag it all the way down
and drop it into the bin.</p>

<h3>Character Details (The User Settings icon)</h3>

<p>Select "Attribute", "Ability", then the sub-category. Tap the various dots
to change the values for your character.<p>

<h3>History (The History icon)</h3>

<p>This is list of your recent dice rolls. It is not interactive.</p>

<h3>Future enhancements</h3>

At some point I plan to address the following minor issues:

<ul>
<li>You can't turn the dice rolling sound off.</li>
<li>The +1 damage to bite attacks in Hispo form is not automatically applied.</li>
<li>There is no support for multiple characters.</li>
</ul>
